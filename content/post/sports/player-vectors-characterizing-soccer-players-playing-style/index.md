title: "Player vectors: Characterizing soccer players' playing styles"
subtitle: ""
summary: "A player’s style of play is a reoccurring concept when discussing
soccer as each player approaches the game in a different way. Unfortunately,
playing style is inherently a subjective and nebulous concept, which makes it
difficult to capture it in a data-driven manner. This post gives an intuitive
explanation of our recent ECMLPKDD 2019 paper on this topic, provides
illustrative use cases and introduces a small interactive demo.
