Probabilistic programming studies probabilistic extensions of programming languages that can be used to model rich domains. The lab has contributed a probabilistic extension of a Prolog, called ProbLog. The resulting language is quite close to a probabilistic database as it imposes probabilities on facts and uses (deterministic) rules to specify dependencies and consequences. Within ProbLog, many techniques for inference and learning have been contributed and ProbLog has also been used in applications in robotics, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
